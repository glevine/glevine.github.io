I'm constantly bumping old knowledge out of my head, replacing it with new knowledge. I felt the need to be able to hold on to the old knowledge somehow. A blog seemed like the perfect forum. So, let the brain dumping begin...

We noticed some chipped accent tiles in our shower when we moved into our house. While watching the handyman replace the tiles, I realized that it didn't look so hard and I vowed to remember things like this so I would never have to hire someone to do it for me again -- although some things are always better left to the pros. I just needed to write down what I was seeing because I'll never remember the nuances five years from now. As the man worked, I quietly typed everything he did into the Notes app on my iPhone.

## Materials
**Thin-set Cement** Quick Permaflex 570

**Grout** Traditions Sanded Tile Grout

**Tools** Razor blade, flat head screw driver, hammer, cardboard, sponge, cloth, and a saw or other cutting device for cutting tile.

## Remove the Broken Tiles
Use a razor blade to score the grout around the tile. Use a flat head screw driver and a hammer to chisel out the old tile. Start about 3/4 to one side of the tile, in the middle, vertically, to avoid cracking other tiles.

As the tile is removed, or once it is completely removed, chisel and scrape away the remaining grout and thin-set. Use the screw driver and hammer to gently chisel along the edges of the adjacent tile to remove the grout.

## Install the New Tiles
Estimate the size the tile should be -- mark it with a pencil -- and cut it to fit the hole with room for grout on all sides. It doesn't need to be an exact measurement.

Mix the thin-set. Apply thin-set to the back of the tile with your fingers and put the tile in place. Apply more thin-set if you need to remove the tile for adjustments, but only if necessary. Use your razor blade and fingers to remove any excess thin-set, as it shouldn't get on the front of the tile. Place small pieces of cardboard in the cracks between tiles to hold the tile in place. Wait about 10 minutes for the thin-set to dry.

Mix the grout. Use your fingers to apply the grout generously over the tile to fill in the edges around the tile. Use a wet sponge to gently wipe away excess grout. Repeat if more grout is needed to fill the gaps.

Wipe the tiles with a damp cloth to clean the surface. Use a razor blade to scrape away any grout that doesn't wipe off.

There you go. My first blog post. And we both should now have the ability to replace our own cracked or chipped bathroom tiles. Good luck to us both!
