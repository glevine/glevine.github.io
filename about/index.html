  <h2>Who Is Harrington Shotgun?</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s my porn name. My real name is Greg Levine and I am currently a  at .</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p><code>who_i_am = ((developer &lt; perpetual_student &amp;&amp; die_hard_orioles_fan) &lt; (husband &amp;&amp; father));</code></p>

<p>The dawn of the internet happened around the time I was 10 years old. Being the oldest child, naturally, I was the first to get a personal computer in our house that was modern enough to really take advantage. I grew up on Prodigy and then AOL, surfing the web and playing games &mdash; oh, and learning to be my family&rsquo;s resident IT guy.</p>

<p>Knowing I was into computers, but not really knowing what to do with that fascination, I stumbled into an opportunity to intern for a startup. While I didn&rsquo;t learn much in the way of coding &mdash; I did everything from writing help documentation to QA to IT &mdash; I learned a lot about working in a dev shop; and it cemented my desire to write software for a living.</p>

<p>So off to get my Computer Science degree, where I began to learn my craft. Being the shy introvert that I was, it took me until my junior year to realize that I could rely on my professors and other students for help. In the meantime, I became very self-reliant and resourceful, which has served me well. But I lost out on what I felt was an opportunity to work with others on a great team. This theme has carried forward throughout my career.</p>

<p>Upon graduation, without a clue as to what I should be doing or where I wanted to go &mdash; and being an enormous baseball fan &mdash; I took a shot at entering the baseball industry. I accepted a job running the IT department at <a href="http://www.baseballamerica.com" title="Baseball America">Baseball America</a>, a magazine dedicated to the development of baseball players. While I was able to assemble a very small team after a few years, I knew that I wasn&rsquo;t yet where I wanted to be. I was hoping to find a mentor who and an environment that would help me to learn what it meant to be a professional software engineer, not just a hacker.</p>

<p>After five years at Baseball America, I moved on to Cisco where I was tasked with developing some internal documentation tools. I got some very good experience, but budget cuts forced me to look elsewhere after only two months. iContact was the next stop and it was everything I was looking for: agile, TDD, smart people everywhere, and great leadership. I got married and started a family. My time at iContact only lasted nine months before we were acquired, but it felt like years in terms of the lessons that I learned.</p>

<p>I stuck around for a few months with the acquiring company, but decided it wasn&rsquo;t the right place for me. SugarCRM came calling with opportunities to become more empowered and continue with a new team that I was really excited to join. Meanwhile, my wife and I bought a house and prepared for a larger family.</p>

<p>And my education continues&hellip;</p>

<h2>About This Blog</h2>

<p>The purpose of this blog is to chronicle anything and everything I learn. Technological, parental, around the house; it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I want to document anything that I find interesting or helpful, that might be useful to myself or others whether now or in the future, or that I just want to share.</p>

<p>In the end, I hope to have a recorded history of the meaningful experiences I&rsquo;ve had both professionally and as a husband and father. And it can serve as a reminder of my accomplishments &mdash; maybe I&rsquo;ll stand to actually recall the important things at review time &mdash; and failures, and especially the things that I hope I never forget.</p>
